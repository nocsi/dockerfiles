# nocsigroup/ansible-lint  

[`nocsigroup/ansible-lint`][1] is a [docker][2] image that bundles the following:  
* **[ansible-lint 2.3.1][3]:** Checks [Ansible][4] playbooks for practices and behaviour that could potentially be improved.    

## Details
* The container runs as "dev" user (i.e. UID 1000). *Please keep this in mind as you mount volumes!* 
* The following volumes exist (and are owned by dev):  
  - /data
  - /ops
  - /state
  - /ansible
  - /home/dev/.ssh
* /ansible is your default workdir. *Knowing this will be helpful when you're mounting your playbook for linting.*   
* /home/dev is $HOME
* The entrypoint for this image is ***/usr/bin/ansible-lint***.  This should be sufficient for most use cases.

## Usage 
This image can easily be extended.  But to analyze your Ansible playbooks:

````
docker run -it --rm \
	-v $(PLAYBOOK_DIR):/ansible \
	nocsigroup/ansible-lint:2.3.1 site.yml
		
````
